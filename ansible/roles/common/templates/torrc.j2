## Tor opens a socks proxy on port 9050 by default -- even if you don't
## configure one below. Set "SocksPort 0" if you plan to run Tor only
## as a relay, and not make any local application connections yourself.
#SocksPort 9050 # Default: Bind to localhost:9050 for local connections.
SocksPort 127.0.0.1:9050 # Bind to this adddress:port too.
SocksPort 192.168.5.1:9050 # Bind to this adddress:port too.

## Logs go to stdout at level "notice" unless redirected by something
## else, like one of the below lines. You can have as many Log lines as
## you want.
##
## We advise using "notice" in most cases, since anything more verbose
## may provide sensitive information to an attacker who obtains the logs.
##
## Send all messages of level 'notice' or higher to /var/log/tor/notices.log
#Log notice file /var/log/tor/notices.log
## Send every possible message to /var/log/tor/debug.log
#Log debug file /var/log/tor/debug.log
## To send all messages to stderr:
#Log debug stderr
## Use the system log instead of Tor's logfiles
Log notice syslog

## When providing proxy server service to a network of computers, 
## change the IPv4 network to "10.192.0.0/10" or "172.16.0.0/12"
VirtualAddrNetworkIPv4 10.192.0.0/10             

## When this option is enabled, and we get a request to resolve an 
## address that ends with one of the suffixes in AutomapHostsSuffixes,
## we map an unused virtual address to that address, and return the 
## new virtual address. This is handy for making ".onion" addresses work
## with applications that resolve an address and then connect to it.

## Open this port to listen for UDP DNS requests, and resolve
