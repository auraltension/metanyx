How to make a bootable SD card for Olimex's A20-SOM, A20-OLinuXino-MICRO, A20-OLinuXino-LIME, A20-OLinuXino-LIME2 with kernel 3.4.90 and debian file system
===============================================================================================

1. Setup of the toolchain
-------------------------
You should make sure you have the tools for building the Linux Kernel and install them if you don’t have them. 
To install new software you should be with super user rights on your Linux machine, so do this type in a terminal.

$ sudo su
you will be asked for your password and then your prompt will change to # which means you are now the super user, all future commands should be run in this mode.

First update apt-get links by typing

# apt-get update
Install the toolchain by typing the following.

# apt-get install gcc-4.7-arm-linux-gnueabihf ncurses-dev uboot-mkimage build-essential git

This will install: GCC compiler used to compile the kernal, The kernel config menu
uboot make image which is required to allow the SD card to book into the linux image, 
Git which allows you to download from the github which holds source code for some of the system, Some other tools for building the kernel

Note that if you use debian may be you will need to add

deb http://www.emdebian.org/debian squeeze main
in the file below:

/etc/apt/sources.list

also install the key:
http://www.emdebian.org/crush/keys.html

after the installation you now have all tools to make your very own A20 kernel image!

2. Building Uboot
-----------------

First let’s make the directory where we will build the A20-OLinuXino-Micro linux:

# mkdir a20-olimex
# cd a20-olimex
Then let’s download the uboot sources from GitHub repository, note there are lot of branches but you have to use sunxi branch.
Note that the u-boot is tested with the next branch:

# git rev-parse --verify HEAD
36080eb05e9a1e96d58e3168631d3cc9c612a0e3

Download u-boot sourses:
# git clone -b sunxi https://github.com/linux-sunxi/u-boot-sunxi.git
After the download you should have a new directory

# cd u-boot-sunxi/
With the following commands you have to configure the uboot for the different boards:

2.1 about A20-OLinuXino_Lime2 board
# make A20-OLinuXino_Lime2_config ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf-

2.2 about A20-SOM board
# make A20-SOM_config ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf-

2.3 about A20-OLinuXino-MICRO board
# make A20-OLinuXino_MICRO_config ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf-

2.4 about A20-OLinuXino-LIME board
# make A20-OLinuXino_Lime_config ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf-

Now type the following command for u-boot building

# make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf-

At the end of the process you can check if everything is OK by

# ls u-boot.bin u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin spl/sunxi-spl.bin

spl/sunxi-spl.bin  u-boot.bin  u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin

If you got these files everything is complete, well done so far

# cd ..
You should be in the following directory

/home/user/a20-olimex#

3. Building kernel sources for A20-Lime2-SOM
----------------------------------------------

Kernel sources for A20 are available on GitHub. Note that the following building is made with the revision below: 

# git rev-parse --verify HEAD
e37d760b363888f3a65cd6455c99a75cac70a7b8

You can download the kernel sources using the following command:

# git clone https://github.com/linux-sunxi/linux-sunxi
After the download go to the kernel directory

# cd linux-sunxi/

3.1. in this point is described how to add SPI support. If you no need from SPI then you can skip 3.1 section

download the  spi-sun7i.c file using wget command 

# wget !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!need link!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

and copy it in drivers/spi directory

# cp spi-sun7i.c /drivers/spi 

download the patch file SPI.patch using wget command

# wget !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!need link!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
and apply the patch:
# patch -p0 < SPI.patch

3.3 configure the system 

Here you need from a20 configuration file – a20_olimex_defconfig . The file contains all kernel module settings.

Download a20_olimex_defconfig  using wget command 

# wget !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!need link!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

then copy a20_olimex_defconfig  file to configs directory:

# cp a20_olimex_defconfig  /arch/arm/configs/
and make:

# make ARCH=arm a20_olimex_defconfig 

The result should be:
configuration written to .config

If you wish to make your changes in the kernel configuration do:

# make ARCH=arm menuconfig
The menuconfig changes a .config text file, which you can view/edit even with a text editor like vi,nano.
With this command you can add or remove different modules for the different peripherials in the kernel. 
Be careful when you change these settings because the kernel can stop working properly.

Note that if you want to have SPI support then you have to enable 
Device driver > SPI support > <*>SUN7I SPI Controller 
							[*] SUN7I SPI Normal DMA mode select

Now you can continue with kernel image compiling 

# make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- -j4 uImage

when this finish’s you will have uImage ready and the result should be:

Kernel: arch/arm/boot/zImage is ready
UIMAGE  arch/arm/boot/uImage
Image Name:   Linux-3.4.90+
Created:      Tue Aug 19 16:23:22 2014
Image Type:   ARM Linux Kernel Image (uncompressed)
Data Size:    4596072 Bytes = 4488.35 kB = 4.38 MB
Load Address: 40008000
Entry Point:  40008000
Image arch/arm/boot/uImage is ready

The next step is kernel modules building:

# make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- -j4 INSTALL_MOD_PATH=out modules
# make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- -j4 INSTALL_MOD_PATH=out modules_install

DONE! At this point you have uboot and kernel modules.

The uImage file is located in linux-sunxi/arch/arm/boot/

The kernel modules are located in

linux-sunxi/out/lib/modules/3.x.xx
where 3.x.xx is kernel version

in our case the directory with modules is:

linux-sunxi/out/lib/modules/3.4.90+

4. Format and setup the SD-card
--------------------------------
We suggest 4GB class 10 micro sd-card but you can use any card between 2GB and 16GB.

First we have to make the correct card partitions, this is done with fdisk.

Plug SD card into your SD card reader and enter in the terminal

# ls /dev/sd
Then press two times <TAB> you will see a list of your sd devices like sda sdb sdc note that some of these devices may be your hard disk so make sure 
you know which one is your sd card before you proceed as you can damage your HDD if you choose the wrong sd-device. 
You can do this by unplugging your sd card reader and identify which “sd” devices remove from the list.
Once you know which device is your sdcard like sda use this text instead of the sdX name in the references below:

# fdisk /dev/sdX
then do these steps:

4.1. p
will list your partitions

if there are already partitions on your card do:

4.2. d enter 1
if you have more than one partitition press d while delete them all

4.3. create the first partition, starting from 2048 
n enter p enter 1 enter enter +16M

4.4. create second partition
n enter p enter 2 enter enter enter

then list the created partitions:
p enter
if you did everything correctly on 4GB card you should see something like:

Disk /dev/sdg: 3980 MB, 3980394496 bytes
123 heads, 62 sectors/track, 1019 cylinders, total 7774208 sectors
Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disk identifier: 0x00000000

   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
/dev/sdg1            2048       34815       16384   83  Linux
/dev/sdg2           34816     7774207     3869696   83  Linux


4.5. press w

write changes to sd card
now we have to format the file system on the card:

the first partition should be vfat as this is FS which the Allwinner bootloader understands

# mkfs.vfat /dev/sdX1
the second should be normal Linux EXT3 FS

# mkfs.ext3 /dev/sdX2


5. Write the Uboot and u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin
-------------------------------------
You should be in /home/user/a20-olimex# directory 
Note that you have to write u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin in /dev/sdX (not sdX1 or sdX2)
Type:

# dd if=u-boot-sunxi/u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin of=/dev/sdX bs=1024 seek=8


6. Write kernel uImage you build to the SD-card
-----------------------------------------------
You should be in the directory below

/home/user/a20-olimex# directory 
# mkdir /mnt/sd
# mount /dev/sdX1 /mnt/sd
copy the Kernel uImage to root directory in partition 1

# cp linux-sunxi/arch/arm/boot/uImage /mnt/sd

7. Write script.bin file
-------------------------
script.bin is a file with very important configuration parameters like port GPIO assignments, DDR memory parameters, Video resolution etc, 
According to the A20 board you use you have to download and write different script.bin file.

7.1 for A20-OLinuXino_Lime2 board download the script.bin file using wget command
# wget !!!!!!!!! need link to A20-OLinuXino_Lime2 script.bin file !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

7.2 for A20-SOM board download the script.bin file using wget command
# wget !!!!!!!!! need link to A20-SOM script.bin file !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

7.3 for A20-OLinuXino-MICRO board download the script.bin file using wget command
# wget !!!!!!!!! need link to A20-OLinuXino-MICRO script.bin file !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

7.4 for A20-OLinuXino-LIME board download the script.bin file using wget command
# wget !!!!!!!!! need link to A20-OLinuXino-Lime script.bin file !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

then copy the downloaded script.bin file to the mounted first partition of the SD card
# cp script.bin /mnt/sd
# sync
# umount /dev/sdX1

8. Debian rootfs
----------------
The Linux Kernel and Uboot are ready, now we have need from Linux distribution rootfs.

Basically the only difference between the different Linux distributions is the rootfs, so if you put Debian rootfs you will have Debian, 
if you put Ubuntu rootfs it will be Ubuntu etc.
How to build one is a long topic, the good thing is that there are many already pre-built so we can just download one and use.

exit the kernel directory

# cd ..
You should be in the directory below

# /home/user/a20-olimex
download debian rootfs - debian_FS_34_90_A20-olimex.tgz using wget command

# wget !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!need link !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

mount your sd card EXT3 FS partition:

# mount /dev/sdX2 /mnt/sd
and unarchive the rootfs

# tar xzvf debian_FS_34_90_A20-olimex.tgz -C /mnt/sd
# ls /mnt/sd
the right result should be:
bin   dev  home  lost+found  mnt  proc  run   selinux  sys  usr
boot  etc  lib   media       opt  root  sbin  srv      tmp  var

Now you have to replace the new generated kernel modules from /home/user/a20-olimex/linux-sunxi/out/lib/modules/  to the new debian file system

# rm -rf /mnt/sd/lib/modules/*

# cp -rfv linux-sunxi/out/lib/modules/3.x.xx+/ /mnt/sd/lib/modules/
where x.xx is the kernel version
in our case:
# cp -rfv linux-sunxi/out/lib/modules/3.4.90+/ /mnt/sd/lib/modules/

replace /lib/firmware folder with the generated /linux-sunxi/out/firmware
#cp -rfv linux-sunxi/out/lib/firmware/ /mnt/sd/lib/

# sync
# umount /mnt/sdX2

at this point you have Debian on your SD card second partition and 
you have an SD card ready to boot debian on A20-SOM or A20-OLinuXino-MICRO or A20-OLinuXino-LIME or A20-OLinuXino-LIME2

Connect USB-SERIAL-CABLE-F to UEXT Tx.Rx and GND, or connect a HDMI screen. 
Put the SD-card apply power according to A20 board type.You should see Uboot and then Kernel messages on the console

default username/password is : root / olimex
